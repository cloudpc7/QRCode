## Overview

The QRCode component is my first challenge. In this challenge I have used basic HTML and CSS to complete this challenge. I stumbled on to FrontEnd Mentor looking through the web for an online code editor and found a site that gives people projects to do. I have used some simple flexbox and css styling for creating this component.

### What I learned

I learned more about creating this README fiel and using simple Markup language. I also learned more about using git and gihub. To practice and keep my learning and coding consistent is a better choice to become more of a pro everyday. 

### Continued development

I believe I need to focus more in my css and using less code in order to complete a project. I kept on going back and forth between certain styles and asking myself if this would be a correct style. I ended up making it better once I have it down. I also need to try and develop my skills with mobile css
